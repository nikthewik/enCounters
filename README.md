# enCounters

This is a project built for the JavaScript Basics exam on [start2impact University](https://www.start2impact.it/).
enCounters is a **space-themed mini game** that combines the dynamics of a **counter** to these of the **game of the goose**.

## Overview

### The assignment

Creating a fully responsive counter, equipped with two +1/-1 buttons to increase or decrease the counter value.

Another requirement is to use only JavaScript (no HTML tags in the body, no library or framework) for element creation and counter display management.

All additional features deemed necessary are allowed.

### Technologies used

- Semantic HTML
- CSS
- JS
- JS Modules
- Flexbox
- Responsive design
- Mobile-first workflow

## My process

I decided to create a space-themed mini game based on a counter and the game of the goose, driven by my passion for video games, the necessity to sharpen my skills in JavaScript, and the desire to make this project useful for others (and for me as well, as a portfolio).

The first step was to write a JS function capable of generating elements based on specific arguments, automating the process and saving me from repetitive tasks.

As I created site elements, I took care of their style with CSS, using a **mobile-first** approach.
Finally, with JS, I focussed on how the game's logic works and the various additional features.

After realising that I wrote 650+ lines of code, I thought it was appropriate to split the `main.js` file into three separate **modules**: `main.js`, `elements.js`, and `quests.js`. In this way the code is more orderly and maintainable.

## Soundtrack

I took an additional step by using GarageBand to compose the game's soundtrack. I aimed to capture a spatial ambiance that evoked the thrill of interstellar exploration.
